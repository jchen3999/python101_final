    "In Python, a package is a way to organize related modules and provide a hierarchical structure to the code. It allows for better code organization, modularity, and reusability. A package is simply a directory (or a folder) that contains Python modules and an additional file called __init__.py. The __init__.py file marks the directory as a Python package.\n",
