# REU Python Basics Class

This repository contains the materials for the REU Python Basics class, organized by day.

## Structure

Each day's lecture slides and/or Jupyter notebooks are stored in their respective folders. Lecture notes are embedded as comments within the .pptx files. Please note that no Jupyter notebook was provided for Day 1 to encourage students to practice coding independently.

## Course Content

- **Days 1-2:** The initial two days focus on basic Python concepts, including data structures, control flow (condition/loop), and defining functions and classes. In-class exercises are integrated into the lecture slides and notebooks. A review notebook for these concepts is available in the `Exercise&Review` folder.
- **Day 3:** The third day introduces packages, basic image representation and processing, and includes mini-projects that cover file I/O and runtime analysis. Tutorials on Markdown and numpy basics are included in the Day 3 notebook, although these topics were not covered in class.

## Exercises and Reviews

After-class exercises can be found in the `Exercise&Review` folder. These exercises are selected from LeetCode that designed to suit beginners.
